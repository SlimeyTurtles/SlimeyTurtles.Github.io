The correct answer should've been 15 which accounts for all 10000 elements by using 2 to the power of how many times it would need to search. | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219514/148165290-1b869e77-383d-4dce-a604-27e41940b9cc.png) <br> **6/6** | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89219514/148165318-05dcc3a7-ef6c-4a88-8500-20af5c746893.png) <br> **6/6** |

Messed up when I was keeping track of the count on paper at repetition #5. **Q27:** Missclicked, should've put the answer that said there are problems that computer algorithms can't solve. Common sense!!!! **Q47:** Hadn't learnt/forgotten (not sure) how binary search works. Just learnt it by watching one of the college board videos and understand the issue. The list has to have all unique numbers for it to work. **Q49:** Did silly math and thought that 2^6 was 128 :( **Q50:** For an algorithm to run in reasonable time, it must take a number of steps less than or equal to a polynomial function. All of the options do this since on is 2n, n^2, and 10, which all work.|

C has the correct output of true because the AND gate evaluates to true. Q17 I chose B because I thought the other options were singular and therefor not represented by bits but that was incorrect. As all digital data can be represented by a sequence of bits. Q24 I chose D I thought it would count odd but it counted even integers. But it sisplayed wrong while B displays the sum of the even integers starting at 2 and ending at 20 which is correct. Q41 I chose D II and III because I thought it removed the entire date tag but it doesn’t. B removes the four rightmost charactcters leaving only the desired description. Q50 I chose C which is I and II but I read the question wrong and thought it was which does not run in reasonable time. Q54I chose B which would only add odd elements from original to new instead of adding even elements. C would add the even elements. Q56 I chose V but I got it the other way around D is correct because version two takes 5 mins longer than 1. Version 2 takes 9 mins.|

The answer had to include sorting by year, filtering by year, and filtering by photographer. |

But one and two are what the teacher can use based on the survey. | <img width="1156" alt="Screen Shot 2021-12-08 at 11 11 36 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89166851/145269425-8789910a-9a25-4e85-976d-fa1c4b97e4df.png"> Q3 I chose A because I thought that one summarized the data most. But it was D because they are looking for the customer who uses AA batteries. Q4 I chose A and B but it was B and D. It's not A because the lowest year value is not guaranteed on the first row of the spreadsheet. It's D because it filters the unknown photographers and the order doesn’t affect which row they’re in. Q5 I chose B because its correct except for the second or. I wasn’t paying attention but A is correct because it has the and there. |

Instead, the program would compare the element to every subsequent element in the list. |
